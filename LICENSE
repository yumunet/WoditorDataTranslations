  - Image Resources: Can reuse, modify, and use outside of WOLF RPG Editor.
  - MIDI Resources: Can reuse only.
  - WAV/OGG Resources: Can reuse, modify, and use outside of WOLF RPG Editor.

- Games using these resources can be sold.
  However, sale of the resources themselves and
  commercial use on the premise that they will be used as resources is prohibited.

- "Can use outside of WOLF RPG Editor" means that they can also be used for
  "works" developed with other game engines. [Added on 01/28/2025]

- It is prohibited to distribute sample game resources included in self-made software. [Added on 01/28/2025]
  However, users may download the sample game resources and use them
  in works developed with that software (can use outside of WOLF RPG Editor).

  * Reuse refers to including the files in a game for use.
  * Modification refers to making changes to the files for use in your own game.
