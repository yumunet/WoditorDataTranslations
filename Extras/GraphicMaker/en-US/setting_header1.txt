# Xsize:NNN and Ysize:NNN specify the size of the generated image.
#
# The rest specifies how the image parts in each folder
# are layered; that is, their display order.
# Note that when "HeadA.png" is loaded, "HeadA$.png" is also loaded automatically and added in the back.
#
# Example:
#  If you set Head=2, Upper Body=1, and Lower Body=0,
#  they will be layered in this order: Head > Upper Body > Lower Body > Lower Body (with $) > Upper Body (with $) > Head (with $).
#  Write the folder name before the "=" sign.
#
# If you write "#" at the beginning of a line, it is treated as a comment.

# Starting with the 5/11/2010 version, you can apply hue changes only to front images (without $) or back images (with $)
# by adding ",F" or ",B" after a number in Folder Settings such as "Head=3,F".
# (* Saturation is applied to both front and back.)
