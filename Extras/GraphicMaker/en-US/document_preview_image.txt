[ If the Preview Image Does Not Appear in the Graphic Maker ]

The most likely reason is that your Windows installation may be missing
the "Gdiplus.dll" library.
This DLL is included by default in standard installations of Windows 7
and later, but it may be missing in lightweight environments, virtual
machines, or some older operating systems.

However, "Gdiplus.dll" is a library that is difficult to redistribute
and is generally not easy to obtain intentionally.
Below are some commonly known methods for obtaining it.


[ Solution 1 ]
Install the .NET Framework 1.1 Redistributable Package.

* Version 1.1 reportedly included Gdiplus.dll in the past to address
  the possibility that Windows XP did not include it.

Official download page for the .NET Framework 1.1 Redistributable Package (Japanese):
https://www.microsoft.com/ja-jp/download/details.aspx?id=26

* As of 04/05/2025, this link may return a 404 error.
  If that happens, try searching for keywords such as
  ".NET Framework 1.1 redistributable download".



[ Solution 2 ]
Obtain Gdiplus.dll from another PC and place it in one of the following locations:

- The same folder as GraphicMaker.exe
- Or the Windows System32 or SysWOW64 folder (requires administrator privileges)

* Be aware that some websites offering individual DLL downloads may be unsafe.
  Use them strictly at your own risk.



[ Solution 3 ]
Reinstall Windows.
Although this requires considerable effort,
it is one way to restore the system to its default configuration.
