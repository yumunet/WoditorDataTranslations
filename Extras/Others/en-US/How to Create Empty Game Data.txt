  How to Create Empty Game Data
--------------------------------

* In version 2 and earlier, empty game data was included in this folder.
  Starting with version 3, the data is built into Editor.exe.
  You can create empty data using the following steps.


1. Delete the Data folder or rename it to a different name,
   then launch Editor.exe.
   (In other words, make sure the Data folder does not exist.)


2. When Editor.exe starts, it will prompt you to create a new Data folder.
   Select "Yes".


3. You can select either "Empty Data with Base RPG System"
   or "Completely Empty Data".

   Empty Data with Base RPG System includes:
   - A basic set of assets
   - A title-screen map and a starting map
   - Preconfigured tileset settings
   - Preconfigured system images and sounds
   - Preconfigured party information
     and more.

   Completely Empty Data contains nothing except the starting map.


4. After the Data folder is created, the Editor opens immediately.
   Either type of data can be test-played right away.
   (However, the completely empty data only shows a completely dark screen.)


That's all. We wish you the best of luck with your new game development!
